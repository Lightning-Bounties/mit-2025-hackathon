### Explanation: what makes sats real?

In the tutorial we used MutinyNet which are "fake" sats, but the systems we learned work for "real" sats as well.

What makes sats "real" or "fake"? In the case of MutinyNet sats what is lacking compared to Mainnet and why does it matter?

A: The thing that makes sats real (or fake) is the same that makes money, laws and anything in the abstract realm, real: our belief in them
**and** the fact that these things are enforced in the concrete realm. Dollars are real because people believe in it **and** it is 
enforced by the US government and everyone else that uses and ascribes value to it. Laws are real because people believe in them
**and** they are enforced by legal systems.

So in order for a sat to be real, we must agree that it has value and enforce this in the real world by exchanging valuable goods or 
services for it; in order for it to be fake we have to do the opposite: agree that it has **no** value and enforce it in the real world 
by **not** exchanging valuable goods or services for it. In the past, testnet3 sats were fake, as people agreed they were fake, without 
value. Later though, it started to be traded for **real** sats, so testnet3 sats also became **real**.

Therefore, the only thing that differs MutinyNet sats from Mainnet sats is the fact that people agree they are fake. If people start
agreeing that they are real, they become real. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
